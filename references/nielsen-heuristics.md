## 1. Visibility of System Status

Keep users informed about what's happening through timely feedback.

- Communicate system state clearly
- Present feedback as quickly as possible (ideally immediately)
- Build trust through open and continuous communication

**Example:** Progress bars, loading indicators, "You are here" markers.

---

## 2. Match Between System and Real World

Use language and concepts familiar to users, not internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions so information appears in a natural order.

- Ensure users understand meaning without external definitions
- Never assume your understanding matches users' understanding
- Conduct user research to uncover familiar terminology and mental models

**Example:** Stovetop controls that match the layout of heating elements.

---

## 3. User Control and Freedom

Provide clear "emergency exits" — support Undo/Redo, cancel buttons, and easy ways to back out of actions.

- Support Undo and Redo functions
- Show a clear way to exit interactions, like a Cancel button
- Make exits clearly labeled and discoverable

**Example:** Undo send in email, back buttons, cancel dialogs.

---

## 4. Consistency and Standards

Follow platform conventions (external consistency) and keep your own product consistent (internal consistency). Users shouldn't wonder if different words mean the same thing.

- Maintain internal consistency within a product or product family
- Follow established industry conventions (external consistency)
- Improve learnability through both types of consistency

**Example:** Hotel check-in counters are always at the front — digital patterns should be just as predictable.

---

## 5. Error Prevention

Better than good error messages: prevent errors in the first place. Use constraints, confirmations, and good defaults.

- Prevent high-cost errors first, then address smaller frustrations
- Avoid slips by providing helpful constraints and good defaults
- Prevent mistakes by removing memory burdens and supporting undo

**Example:** Guard rails on mountain roads. Confirmation dialogs before destructive actions.

---

## 6. Recognition Rather than Recall

Make elements, actions, and options visible. Don't force users to remember information across screens — show it.

- Let people recognize information rather than forcing recall
- Offer help in context at the moment users require it
- Reduce the information users must remember

**Example:** Dropdown menus, recent searches, breadcrumbs.

---

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Cater to both novice and expert users. Provide accelerators (keyboard shortcuts, gestures) and allow customization.

- Provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures
- Offer personalization by tailoring content for individual users
- Allow customization so users can adjust how the product works

**Example:** Keyboard shortcuts hidden from novices but available to power users.

---

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Every extra element competes with relevant content. Keep interfaces focused on essentials — less noise, more signal.

- Keep content and visual design focused on essentials
- Don't let unnecessary elements distract from needed information
- Prioritize content and features to support primary goals

**Example:** A clean dashboard showing only key metrics vs. a cluttered one showing everything.

---

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should be in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and suggest a solution. No error codes.

- Use traditional error-message visuals like bold, red text
- Express problems in language users understand; avoid technical jargon
- Offer users solutions, such as shortcuts to resolve errors immediately

**Example:** "Wrong way" road signs. Form validation that says what to fix.

---

## 10. Help and Documentation

Ideally the system needs no explanation, but when it does — make help searchable, contextual, and action-oriented.

- Ensure help documentation is easy to search
- Present documentation in context at the moment users need it
- List concrete steps to be carried out

**Example:** Tooltips, onboarding walkthroughs, contextual help buttons.

## How to Use for Design Critiques

Score each heuristic 1–5 for any design:

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Usability catastrophe — must fix |
| 2 | Major problem — high priority |
| 3 | Minor problem — low priority |
| 4 | Cosmetic only — fix if time allows |
| 5 | No usability problem |

This scoring system is used in **Prompt 06 — The Design Critique Partner**.
