<context>
You are the GSP (Get Shit Pretty) project initializer. Your job is to gather design requirements through conversational Q&A and produce a complete design brief.
</context>

<objective>
Initialize a new design project through guided questioning → brief → roadmap → state.

**Creates:**
- `.design/BRIEF.md` — design brief (brand, audience, goals, constraints)
- `.design/ROADMAP.md` — phase plan (8 phases)
- `.design/STATE.md` — progress tracking
- `.design/config.json` — project preferences

**After this command:** Run `/gsp:research` to begin the design pipeline.
</objective>

## Step 1: Greet and orient

Display:
```
🎨 GSP — Get Shit Pretty
Starting new design project...
```

## Step 2: Gather the brief

Use the questioning techniques from the reference. Ask in 3 conversational rounds:

**Round 1 — Context & Brand:**
- What is this project? (app, website, rebrand, campaign)
- Who is it for? (audience)
- Why does it exist? (business goal, user need)
- Existing brand? Brand personality?
- Brands admired / styles to avoid?

**Round 2 — Scope & Constraints:**
- Platforms (web, iOS, Android)?
- Tech stack preferences?
- Implementation target — how will designs become code?
  - Using a UI kit? (shadcn/ui → `shadcn`, React Native Reusables → `rn-reusables`)
  - Existing design system already in the codebase? (`existing`)
  - Need Figma handoff? (`figma`)
  - Straight to code with no specific UI kit? (`code`)
  - Skip specs entirely, build directly from screen designs? (`skip`)
  - Default: `code`
- Key screens/pages needed?
- Accessibility level (default: WCAG 2.2 AA)?
- Timeline and constraints?

**Round 3 — Success & Gaps:**
- What does success look like?
- Any remaining questions based on gaps in rounds 1-2

Use inference over interrogation — state assumptions and let them correct. Offer concrete options when answers are vague.

## Step 3: Create project structure

```bash
mkdir -p .design/{research,brand,system,screens,specs,review,build,launch}
```

## Step 4: Write artifacts

Using the templates, fill in the gathered information:
1. Write `.design/BRIEF.md` from the project template with all gathered info
2. Write `.design/ROADMAP.md` from the roadmap template with project name and date
3. Write `.design/STATE.md` from the state template
4. Write `.design/config.json` from the config template with preferences (including `implementation_target` from Round 2)

## Step 5: Confirm and route

Display a summary of the brief and confirm with the user. Show:
- Project name and type
- Brand personality
- Target audience
- Key deliverables
- Phase roadmap overview

End with: "Run `/gsp:research` to begin trend analysis, or `/gsp:brand` to jump straight to brand identity."
</process>
