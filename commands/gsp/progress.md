## Step 1: Find project

Check for `.design/STATE.md` in the current directory.

If not found, display:
```
No GSP project found. Run /gsp:new-project to start one.
```

## Step 2: Read state

Read `.design/STATE.md` and `.design/BRIEF.md`.

## Step 3: Calculate prettiness

Count completed phases out of 8. Calculate percentage.

## Step 4: Display progress

```

Project: {PROJECT_NAME}
Prettiness: ██████░░░░░░░░░░ 37.5% (3/8 phases)

Phase Progress:
  ✅ 1. Research    — complete
  ✅ 2. Brand       — complete
  ✅ 3. System      — complete
  ⬜ 4. Design      — pending        ← you are here
  ⬜ 5. Spec        — pending
  ⬜ 6. Review      — pending
  ⬜ 7. Build       — pending
  ⬜ 8. Launch      — pending

Review Loops: {COUNT}
```

Use ✅ for complete, 🔄 for in-progress/needs-revision, ⬜ for pending.
